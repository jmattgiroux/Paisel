## The Cherno

The Paisel engine is based on the Hazel engine tutorials on YouTube, created by
The Cherno, found here: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject  
The GitHub repository for the Hazel engine can be found here:
https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel  
The Paisel engine was created as a new project, rather than a branch of The
Cherno's work.  
Despite that, The Cherno's tutorial series has been a huge help for this
project, and so they should receive recognition for their contribution to this
project.  
Otherwise, this project was created by the author without any existing
affiliations with The Cherno, and does not necessarily represent any of their
views.

## Robert C. Martin

Robert C. Martin, or, "Uncle Bob", has been a guiding mentor for this project,
through their books and tutorials (such as "Clean Code" and "The Clean Coder").
Because of that, the author of this project felt they should receive recognition
for their contribution to this project. This project was created by the author
without any existing affiliations with Robert C. Martin, and does not
necessarily represent any of their views.

# Notes

## The Project's Name

As of this project's inception on October 1, 2022, (according to Urban
Dictionary) Paisel was a sort of non-sense word used as a fun replacement for a
noun, adjective, or verb, without any derogatory or profane meanings, as far as
the project's author was aware.  
Hopefully that doesn't change, but if it does, then please keep in mind that
this project's title was chosen in good faith without intent to offend.  
It was also chosen as an homage to the Hazel engine tutorials created by The
Cherno, which made the creation of this game engine possible.
